# NumberCounterJava

A simple Java console application that allows users to input integers and keeps track of how many are positive, negative, or zero. The program continues running based on user input and stops when the user chooses to exit.

## 💡 Features

- Counts:
  - Positive numbers
  - Negative numbers
  - Zeros
- Loop-based input system
- User-controlled termination of input
- Simple and beginner-friendly Java logic using:
  - `Scanner` class for input
  - Conditional statements
  - `while` loop

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to press `1` to continue or `0` to stop.
2. If the user enters `1`, they're prompted to enter a number.
3. Based on the number entered, it updates the appropriate counter:
   - Positive, Negative, or Zero.
4. This repeats until the user enters `0` to stop.
5. Once stopped, the program prints the total counts.
